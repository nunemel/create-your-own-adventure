Feng Shui (pinyin: fēng shuǐ, pronounced [fɤ́ŋ ʂwèi] ( listen) fung shway) is a 
Chinese philosophical system of harmonizing everyone with the surrounding environment. 
It is closely linked to Taoism. The term feng shui literally translates as "wind-water" in English. 
This is a cultural shorthand taken from the passage of the now-lost Classic of Burial recorded in Guo 
Pu's commentary:[1] Feng shui is one of the Five Arts of Chinese Metaphysics, classified as physiognomy 
(observation of appearances through formulas and calculations). The feng shui practice discusses architecture in metaphoric 
terms of "invisible forces" that bind the universe, earth, and humanity together, known as qi.
